# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 
This repo has been created while attending **[ML ZoomCamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp)** organized by [Alexey Grigorev](https://linkedin.com/in/agrigorev)) and team. This ZoomCamp is spread across 14 modules for upto 4 months.

## Targeted Open Learning
Going forward, I'm going to update this README.md on a weekly basis with an **Overview** for the week, **Notes** prepared during the week, **Outcomes** from the learning process, and, maybe, social **Media** posts that I write about the weekly outcome. Good Luck and Happy Learning!
