## üìñ Targeted Open Learning
Going forward, I'm going to update this README.md on a weekly basis with an **Overview** for the week, **Notes** prepared during the week, **Outcomes** from the learning process, and, maybe, social **Media** posts that I write about the weekly outcome. Good Luck and Happy Learning!
