# Week 6 
These notes were prepared during week-6 of ML Zoomcamp. 

# 1 Credit risk scoring project
- Make decisions on a applicant based on his/her credit score. 
- g(xi) -> prob of default
- Brief about this week
    - Look at dataset
    - data cleaning and prep
    - Decision tree
    - DT algos
    - DT parameter tuning
    - Ensemble and Random forest
    - Gradient Boosting and XGBoost
    - Select best of 3 models 

# 2 Data cleaning and preparation
- Download the [dataset](https://github.com/gastonstat/CreditScoring/raw/master/CreditScoring.csv) using wget
- `head filename.csv` to see first 10 lines of the file - linux command 
- Read the dataset using pandas 
- `Standardize` column names 
- Try to extract meaningful information from different data columns
- `Map column features` as per category data - This is done to have a much better understanding about the dataset.
- Perform EDA on the dataset
- Prepare dataset for modeling
