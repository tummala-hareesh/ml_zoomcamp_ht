# Week-1 
These notes prepared during week-1 of ML Zoomcamp. 

## 1 Introduction to Machine Learning
- ML using simple example 
    - Buy a used car - Estimate approximate price that doesn't make or break ones financial situation
    - General human way is to examine existing car ads prices and put an estimate.
    - ML is doing the same above using data.
    - Data -> Expert -> Patterns 
    - Data -> ML model -> Patterns
- `Features ` - information about cars
- `Target` - what we are predicting
- `Model` - train a model; encapsulate all patterns identified from data
- Feature + Model = Predictions
