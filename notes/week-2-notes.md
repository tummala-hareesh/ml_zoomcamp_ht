# Week-2
These notes prepared during week-2 of ML Zoomcamp. 

# 1 Car price prediction project
- Develop a model to help user predict car price. 
- Dataset from Kaggle - [Car Features and MSRP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset)
- Project Plan 
    - Preapre data and do EDA 
    - Use linear regression for predicting price
    - Use the internal of linear regression 
    - Evaluting the model with RSME 
    - Feature Engineering 
    - Regularization 
    - Using the model
