# Week 8
These notes were prepared during week-8 of ML Zoomcamp. The topic for this week is `Neural Networks and Deep Learning`.

# 1 Fashion classification
- Tabluar data in previous lessons. 
- Use Images -> Multi-class classification 
- **Usecase**: User comes to website -> Upload a picture -> Fashion Classification Service (T-shirt) -> Selection of category faster
- Goal is to suggest a category to make it easier for user
- Sub-set of Fashion dataset 
- 10 categories of clothes ~ 5000 images
- Train, test and Validation is already present
- Practical application of neural network
- Not theoritical - Go to `CS231n Stanford` for more theory 


# 1b Setting up the Environment on Saturn Cloud
- Saturn cloud for using GPUs
- Configure SSH to push Saturn notebook to Github (if needed)
- `clothes-classsification-mlzoomcamp`

# 2 TensorFlow and Keras
- Framework for doing deep-learning
- Keras is higher-level abstract on top of Tensorflow
- Load image with a target_size as a neural network expect image with a specific size.
- `PIL` - Processing image library in python 
- Image = Numpy array with 3 channels
    - RED: 0-255
    - GREEN: 0-255
    - BLUE: 0-255
- Each numpy array element is a pixel with (R,G,B) values
